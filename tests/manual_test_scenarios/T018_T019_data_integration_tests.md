# T018-T019: CSV Data Files & Integration - Manual Test Results

## Overview
Testing comprehensive CSV data files creation and enrollment relationship management.

## Test Execution Date
Executed: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

## Data File Validation Tests

### CSV Files Created
✓ `data/students.csv` - 10 student records with proper headers
✓ `data/courses.csv` - 8 course records covering core subjects  
✓ `data/assessments.csv` - 12 assessment records with calculated grades
✓ `data/enrollments.csv` - 30 enrollment relationships

### Data Integrity Checks

#### Students Data Validation
- [ ] All roll numbers are unique (001-010)
- [ ] All email addresses follow proper format
- [ ] Enrollment dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] No empty required fields

#### Courses Data Validation  
- [ ] All course IDs are unique (MATH101, ENG101, etc.)
- [ ] Credit values are realistic (1-4 credits)
- [ ] Capacity limits are reasonable (20-30 students)
- [ ] All instructors are named

#### Assessments Data Validation
- [ ] Assessment IDs follow pattern (ASS001-ASS012)
- [ ] All have valid student roll numbers (001-010)
- [ ] All have valid course IDs (MATH101, ENG101, etc.)
- [ ] Grades follow 30% internal + 70% final = total formula
- [ ] Grade calculations are mathematically correct

#### Enrollments Data Validation
- [ ] Enrollment IDs follow pattern (ENR001-ENR030)
- [ ] All student roll numbers exist in students.csv
- [ ] All course IDs exist in courses.csv
- [ ] All enrollments marked as "Active"
- [ ] No duplicate student-course combinations

## FileHandler Integration Tests

### Load Operations
- [ ] `loadStudentsFromFile()` - loads all 10 students correctly
- [ ] `loadCoursesFromFile()` - loads all 8 courses correctly
- [ ] `loadAssessmentsFromFile()` - loads all 12 assessments correctly
- [ ] `loadEnrollments()` - establishes 30 bidirectional relationships

### Save Operations
- [ ] `saveStudentsToFile()` - preserves all student data
- [ ] `saveCoursesToFile()` - preserves all course data
- [ ] `saveAssessmentsToFile()` - preserves all assessment data
- [ ] `saveEnrollments()` - generates enrollment CSV from relationships

### Relationship Management
- [ ] `enrollStudentInCourse()` - creates new enrollment relationship
- [ ] `withdrawStudentFromCourse()` - removes enrollment relationship
- [ ] `isStudentEnrolledInCourse()` - checks enrollment status correctly

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid student roll number handling
- [ ] Invalid course ID handling
- [ ] Duplicate enrollment prevention
- [ ] Missing file handling
- [ ] CSV format validation

## Bulk Operations Tests

### Data Loading Integration
- [ ] `loadAllData()` - loads students, courses, assessments, enrollments
- [ ] Bidirectional relationships established correctly
- [ ] Student objects contain course references
- [ ] Course objects contain student references

### Data Saving Integration
- [ ] `saveAllData()` - saves all entities with relationships
- [ ] Backup created before saving
- [ ] All CSV files updated consistently
- [ ] Data integrity maintained

## Sample Data Quality Tests

### Realistic Sample Data
- [ ] Student names are appropriate for primary school
- [ ] Course subjects cover primary curriculum
- [ ] Assessment grades show realistic distribution
- [ ] Enrollment patterns make sense

### Data Relationships
- [ ] Students enrolled in 2-4 courses each
- [ ] Courses have 3-5 students each
- [ ] Assessments exist for enrolled student-course pairs
- [ ] Grade calculations match enrollment patterns

## Edge Case Testing

### File Operations
- [ ] Missing data directory handling
- [ ] Corrupted CSV file handling
- [ ] Permission denied scenarios
- [ ] Large data set performance

### Relationship Constraints
- [ ] Course capacity limits respected
- [ ] Student enrollment limits enforced
- [ ] Assessment-enrollment consistency
- [ ] Orphaned record prevention

## Performance Validation

### Loading Performance
- [ ] All 10 students load in < 50ms
- [ ] All 8 courses load in < 30ms  
- [ ] All 12 assessments load in < 40ms
- [ ] 30 enrollments processed in < 60ms

### Memory Usage
- [ ] Smart pointer management working correctly
- [ ] No memory leaks in relationship establishment
- [ ] Efficient storage of bidirectional references

## Expected Outcomes

### Data Completeness
- All sample data loaded without errors
- All relationships established correctly
- Data integrity maintained throughout operations

### Functional Correctness
- FileHandler operations complete successfully
- Enrollment management works bidirectionally
- Assessment data properly linked to students/courses

### System Readiness
- Data persistence layer fully operational
- Ready for System Controller implementation (T020-T021)
- Foundation established for menu interface integration

## Test Results Summary

**Status**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL / [ ] PARTIAL

**Issues Found**:
- [ ] None
- [ ] Minor issues (list below)
- [ ] Major issues requiring fixes

**Performance**:
- [ ] Meets performance targets
