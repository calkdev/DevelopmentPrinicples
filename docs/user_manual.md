## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Application Won't Start
**Problem**: Double-clicking does nothing or shows error
**Solutions**:
1. Check system requirements are met
2. Try running as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)
3. Ensure data folder exists in same location as application
4. Contact IT support if antivirus is blocking

#### Data Not Saving
**Problem**: Changes disappear when restarting application
**Solutions**:
1. Check data folder permissions (must be writable)
2. Ensure sufficient disk space available
3. Close other applications that might lock files
4. Run application as administrator if needed

#### Student ID Already Exists
**Problem**: Cannot add student with specific ID
**Solutions**:
1. Use View Students to check existing IDs
2. Choose a different, unique Student ID
3. If updating existing student, use Update function instead

#### Cannot Enroll Student in Course
**Problem**: Enrollment fails with error message
**Solutions**:
1. Verify Student ID exists (use View Students)
2. Verify Course Name exists (use View Courses)
3. Check if student already enrolled in course
4. Ensure exact spelling of course name

#### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Application running slowly
**Solutions**:
1. Close other applications to free memory
2. Check if data files are extremely large (>10,000 records)
3. Restart the application
4. Consider data archiving for very old records

### Error Messages and Meanings

| Error Message | Meaning | Solution |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| "Student ID already exists" | Duplicate student ID | Use different ID or update existing |
| "Course not found" | Course name doesn't exist | Create course first or check spelling |
| "Invalid date format" | Date not DD/MM/YYYY | Use correct format (e.g., 15/03/2015) |
| "Score must be non-negative" | Negative assessment score | Enter positive number or zero |
| "Weighting must be 0.0-1.0" | Invalid weighting value | Use decimal between 0.0 and 1.0 |
| "Could not save data" | File write error | Check permissions and disk space |

## System Administration

### Installation for School Network

**For IT Administrators**:
1. **Install Location**: Recommended `C:\Program Files\PokenoSouthPrimary\`
2. **Data Location**: Use shared network drive for multi-user access
3. **Permissions**: Users need read/write access to data folder
4. **Backup**: Schedule automatic backup of data folder

### Multi-User Setup

**Option 1: Shared Data (Recommended)**
- Install application on each computer
- Point all installations to shared data folder on network drive
- Ensure network permissions allow read/write access

**Option 2: Individual Installations**
- Each user has own data copy
- Use manual data synchronization when needed
- Export/import functions for data sharing

### Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**
   - Data files contain student personal information
   - Ensure appropriate file permissions
   - Consider encryption for sensitive environments

2. **Access Control**
   - Application has no built-in user authentication
   - Rely on operating system user accounts
   - Consider folder-level permissions for data access

3. **Audit Trail**
   - System does not log changes automatically
   - Consider external file monitoring for change tracking
   - Regular backups provide change history

### Performance Tuning

**For Large Student Populations (>1000 students)**:
1. **Hardware Recommendations**
   - Minimum 1GB RAM
   - SSD storage for faster file access
   - Regular disk cleanup

2. **Data Management**
   - Archive old student records annually
   - Keep current year data only in active system
   - Use data compression for archived files

## Backup and Recovery

### Daily Backup Procedure

**Automated Backup (Recommended)**:
1. Schedule automatic copy of `data` folder
2. Copy to network drive or cloud storage
3. Retain last 7 days of backups

**Manual Backup**:
1. Close the application completely
2. Copy entire `data` folder to safe location
3. Name backup with date (e.g., `data_backup_2025-09-10`)
4. Store multiple backups for safety

### Recovery Procedures

**Restore from Backup**:
1. Close application if running
2. Delete current `data` folder
3. Copy backup folder and rename to `data`
4. Start application and verify data loaded correctly

**Partial Data Recovery**:
1. Close application
2. Replace specific CSV files from backup
3. Ensure all three files (students, courses, assessments) are consistent
4. Start application and check for errors

### Disaster Recovery Planning

**Complete System Failure**:
1. Reinstall application on new computer
2. Restore `data` folder from most recent backup
3. Verify all student information intact
4. Test all functions before resuming normal operations

**Data Corruption**:
1. Check backup files for uncorrupted version
2. Compare with paper records if available
3. Restore from most recent good backup
4. Re-enter any data created since backup

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: Can multiple people use the system at the same time?**
A: The system is designed for single-user operation. For multi-user environments, each person should have their own copy or use careful coordination to avoid data conflicts.

**Q: How many students can the system handle?**
A: The system has been tested with over 1,000 students and performs well. For very large schools (>2,000 students), consider performance optimization strategies.

**Q: Can I print student reports?**
A: The current version displays information on screen. You can copy information and paste into a word processor for printing formatted reports.

### Data Management

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: All data is stored in CSV files in the `data` folder alongside the application. This data stays on your local computer unless you choose to back it up elsewhere.

**Q: Can I import data from our old system?**
A: Yes, if your old system can export CSV files. Format your data to match the system's CSV format (see Data File Format section) and place files in the `data` folder.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally delete a student?**
A: Student deletion is permanent and cannot be undone from within the application. You would need to restore from a backup or manually re-enter the student information.

### Technical Issues

**Q: The application crashes when I try to view students. What should I do?**
A: This usually indicates a problem with the students.csv file. Check the file format and ensure all required fields are present. Restore from backup if necessary.

**Q: Can I run this on a tablet or iPad?**
A: No, this is a desktop application that requires Windows, Mac, or Linux operating system. It will not run on mobile devices or tablets.

**Q: How do I update to a new version?**
A: Download the new version and replace the old application file. Keep your existing `data` folder to preserve all student information.

### Academic Management

**Q: How are weighted grades calculated?**
A: The system multiplies each assessment score by its weighting, then adds all weighted scores together. For example: (Score1 × Weight1) + (Score2 × Weight2) = Overall Grade.

**Q: Can I change a student's ID after creating them?**
A: No, Student IDs cannot be changed once created. You would need to delete the student and recreate them with a new ID, losing their assessment history.

**Q: How do I track student progress over time?**
A: Add assessments regularly with appropriate weightings. The system will automatically calculate overall performance. Use consistent assessment naming for easy tracking.
