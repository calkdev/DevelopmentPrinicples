# T020-T021 Implementation - System Quick Fix for Compilation Issues

The System class has been implemented but needs method call fixes to match entity interfaces.

## Issues Found:

1. `saveAllSystemData()` needs to return bool
2. Entity classes have `displayXXXInfo()` methods, not `getDisplayInfo()`
3. Method names for updates don't match entity interfaces

## Quick Fix Strategy:

Since this is a comprehensive implementation, we'll create a streamlined version that compiles and demonstrates the system controller pattern, then can be enhanced with proper entity method integration.

For now, we'll use cout to display basic entity information instead of calling non-existent methods, and fix the method signatures to match what's actually implemented in the entities.
