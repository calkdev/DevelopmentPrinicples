# Feature Specification: Object-Oriented Class Design Following Proven TalentHub Patterns

**Feature Branch**: `003-class-design-demonstrating`  
**Created**: 9 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Class design demonstrating junior developer's application of TalentHub Wellington's successful patterns:

Student class (enhanced TalentHub Student pattern for learning):
- Private: const int rollNumber (TalentHub's immutable ID concept), personal info, vector<Course*> enrolledCourses, vector<Assessment> assessments
- Public: CRUD operations following TalentHub's comprehensive interface design, enrollment management
- Learning focus: Why TalentHub used const ID, how composition improves on TalentHub's association pattern
- Junior dev growth: Extending TalentHub's proven Student model with new assessment relationships

Course class (direct application of TalentHub Course success):
- Private: courseId, courseName, credits, vector<Student*> enrolledStudents (TalentHub's proven relationship model)
- Public: CRUD operations, enrollment management following TalentHub's interface patterns
- Learning emphasis: Understanding TalentHub's bidirectional relationship handling

Assessment class (new entity following TalentHub design principles):
- Private: assessmentId, studentRollNumber, courseId, internalMarks (30%), finalMarks (70%), calculated totals
- Public: CRUD operations, weighted calculation methods following TalentHub's validation patterns
- Junior dev focus: Applying TalentHub's data validation approach to new business rules

System class (adapted from TalentHub's successful System controller):
- Composition with all entities (TalentHub's proven ownership model)
- Menu-driven interface (TalentHub's successful UX pattern)
- Authentication and session management (enhanced from TalentHub's approach)
- Learning objective: Understanding TalentHub's controller pattern and adapting it for new requirements

FileHandler class (direct implementation of TalentHub's proven approach):
- Static methods for CSV operations (TalentHub's successful repository pattern)
- Comprehensive error handling (TalentHub's robust file management)
- Data validation and integrity (TalentHub's proven data consistency approach)
- Junior dev understanding: Why TalentHub chose static methods and how to maintain this pattern"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a junior software developer learning professional object-oriented design, I need to create a class structure that demonstrates mastery of proven enterprise patterns from TalentHub Wellington, enabling me to show understanding of encapsulation, composition, inheritance principles while delivering functional student management capabilities that meet educational institution requirements and provide clear evidence of technical growth for senior developer mentorship evaluation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a junior developer needs to demonstrate OOP encapsulation mastery, **When** they implement class designs with proper private/public interfaces following TalentHub patterns, **Then** each class protects its data appropriately while providing comprehensive access methods
2. **Given** senior developers need to assess composition understanding, **When** they review the Student class design with Assessment collection management, **Then** they can identify proper ownership relationships and lifecycle management improvements over TalentHub's association patterns
3. **Given** the system needs to handle educational data relationships, **When** administrators interact with student-course-assessment entities, **Then** all operations maintain referential integrity using bidirectional relationship patterns proven in TalentHub
4. **Given** mentorship sessions require pattern recognition assessment, **When** senior developers examine the class interfaces and relationships, **Then** they can clearly identify TalentHub pattern applications and evaluate learning progression
5. **Given** future system extensions are required, **When** new educational entities need to be added, **Then** the class design supports extension through consistent pattern application and clear inheritance opportunities
6. **Given** data persistence operations are needed, **When** the system saves and loads educational records, **Then** the FileHandler class demonstrates proper repository pattern implementation with TalentHub's proven error handling approach

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a junior developer misapplies encapsulation principles in class design?
- How does the system maintain data integrity when student-course-assessment relationships become complex?
- What occurs when class interface design needs to demonstrate specific OOP principle understanding?
- How does the system support learning progression from basic class structure to advanced relationship management?
- What happens when mentorship feedback requires class design modifications while maintaining pattern consistency?
