# Tasks: Architecture Documentation with PlantUML Class Diagrams

**Input**: Current codebase analysis from `/src/` directory
**Prerequisites**: Completed T030-T052 implementations, existing class files (.hpp/.cpp)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Scan entire codebase structure in src/ directory
   → Extract: class definitions, relationships, dependencies
   → Analyze: inheritance, composition, associations
2. Generate PlantUML class diagram code
   → Create: comprehensive class diagram with relationships
   → Include: all entities, system controller, file handler
3. Create architectural documentation report
   → Document: class responsibilities, relationships, design patterns
   → Include: PlantUML code and rendered diagram reference
4. Validate documentation completeness
   → All classes documented?
   → All relationships captured?
   → Design patterns identified?
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 4.1: Codebase Analysis
- [ ] T053 [P] Scan and analyze Student.hpp class structure with immutable roll number, composition patterns, and bidirectional Course relationships
- [ ] T054 [P] Scan and analyze Course.hpp class structure with bidirectional Student relationships and enrollment management
- [ ] T055 [P] Scan and analyze Assessment.hpp class structure inheriting from Grade with weighted calculation and immutable entity references
- [ ] T056 [P] Scan and analyze Grade.hpp abstract base class interface for polymorphic grade calculation
- [ ] T057 [P] Scan and analyze GradeCalculator.hpp with strategy pattern implementation (WeightedAverageCalculator, BestNOutOfMCalculator)
- [ ] T058 [P] Scan and analyze System.hpp main controller class with entity composition and comprehensive CRUD operations
- [ ] T059 [P] Scan and analyze FileHandler.hpp static utility class with repository pattern for CSV operations
- [ ] T060 [P] Scan and analyze common.hpp shared validation utilities and helper functions
- [ ] T061 [P] Scan and analyze Usings.hpp namespace aliases and macro definitions for code organization

## Phase 4.2: PlantUML Generation
- [ ] T059 Create comprehensive PlantUML class diagram code in docs/architecture/class-diagram.puml
- [ ] T060 Generate PlantUML relationship mappings for entity associations in docs/architecture/class-diagram.puml
- [ ] T061 Add PlantUML design pattern annotations and stereotypes in docs/architecture/class-diagram.puml

## Phase 4.3: Documentation Report
- [ ] T062 Create architecture documentation report in docs/architecture/class-diagram-analysis.md
- [ ] T063 Document class responsibilities and design patterns in docs/architecture/class-diagram-analysis.md
- [ ] T064 Document relationship analysis and architectural decisions in docs/architecture/class-diagram-analysis.md

## Phase 4.4: Integration and Validation
- [ ] T065 Integrate PlantUML diagram with documentation report in docs/architecture/class-diagram-analysis.md
- [ ] T066 Validate documentation completeness and accuracy against actual codebase
- [ ] T067 [P] Update project README.md with architecture documentation references

## Dependencies
- Analysis tasks (T053-T058) before PlantUML generation (T059-T061)
- PlantUML generation (T059-T061) before documentation report (T062-T064)
- Documentation complete before integration (T065-T067)

## Notes
- [P] tasks analyze different files simultaneously
- PlantUML code should be complete and renderable
- Documentation must accurately reflect current implementation
- Focus on TalentHub enterprise patterns used in the codebase
- Include composition, association, and dependency relationships
- Document design patterns: Repository, Composition, Static Factory, etc.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **class-diagram.puml**: Complete PlantUML class diagram code
2. **class-diagram-analysis.md**: Comprehensive architecture documentation with:
   - Class overview and responsibilities
   - Relationship analysis (composition, association, dependency)
   - Design pattern identification and explanation
   - Architectural decision rationale
   - PlantUML diagram integration
3. **Updated README.md**: References to architecture documentation

## Architecture Focus Areas
- **Entity Relationships**: Student ↔ Course (many-to-many), Student → Assessment (composition)
- **Design Patterns**: Repository pattern (FileHandler), Composition (System class), Static utility design
- **TalentHub Patterns**: Immutable IDs, bidirectional relationships, comprehensive validation
- **Modern C++**: Smart pointers, RAII, const correctness, composition over inheritance
