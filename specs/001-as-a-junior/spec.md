# Feature Specification: C++ Student Management System for Pokeno South Primary School

**Feature Branch**: `001-as-a-junior`  
**Created**: 9 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "As a junior software developer at a prominent Auckland-based company, I'm tasked with creating a C++ Student Management System for Pokeno South Primary School, following the proven architectural patterns from our team's successful TalentHub Wellington certification management system (detailed in the uploaded [PROJECT_OVERVIEW - previous project example.md] file). This project serves as both a real-world client deliverable and a learning exercise demonstrating my understanding of enterprise-level OOP principles. The system manages student registration with unique roll numbers, course enrollment, grade tracking with weighted assessments (internal 30%, final 70%), and comprehensive reporting capabilities. Building on TalentHub's proven success as documented in the project overview, I'll implement the same reliable layered architecture, composition relationships, CSV persistence, menu-driven interface, and robust input validation patterns. The solution must showcase proper software engineering practices including complete CRUD operations (Add, View, Edit, Delete) for all entities, thorough documentation suitable for senior developer review and mentorship feedback, and code structure that demonstrates my growth in understanding established enterprise patterns while maintaining the quality standards proven in our TalentHub Wellington project."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: Student management system for primary school
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: students, courses, grades, assessments, roll numbers, CRUD operations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All key requirements clearly specified in description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for school administration identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement derived from educational context
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Students, Courses, Grades, Assessments identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec ready for planning phase
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a school administrator at Pokeno South Primary School, I need a comprehensive student management system that allows me to register new students with unique roll numbers, enroll them in courses, track their academic progress through weighted assessments, and generate reports for parents and education authorities. The system must handle the daily administrative tasks of managing student records, course assignments, and grade calculations efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new student needs enrollment, **When** administrator enters student details and assigns a roll number, **Then** the system creates a unique student record and confirms successful registration
2. **Given** an existing student, **When** administrator enrolls them in available courses, **Then** the system updates the student's course list and maintains enrollment records
3. **Given** a student has completed assessments, **When** administrator enters internal (30%) and final (70%) assessment scores, **Then** the system calculates and stores the weighted final grade
4. **Given** completed grade data exists, **When** administrator requests academic reports, **Then** the system generates comprehensive reports showing student progress and course performance
5. **Given** student information needs updating, **When** administrator modifies student details, **Then** the system updates records while maintaining data integrity and audit trails
6. **Given** a student withdraws from school, **When** administrator removes the student record, **Then** the system safely archives the data and updates all related course enrollments

### Edge Cases
- What happens when attempting to assign a duplicate roll number?
- How does the system handle grade calculations when assessment scores are missing?
- What occurs when trying to enroll a student in a course that doesn't exist?
- How does the system respond when deleting a student who has existing grade records?
- What happens when generating reports for students with incomplete assessment data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow administrators to register new students with unique roll numbers, personal details (name, contact information, emergency contacts), and enrollment date
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain a unique roll number for each student that cannot be duplicated or modified once assigned
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow administrators to create and manage course offerings with course codes, names, descriptions, and duration information
- **FR-004**: System MUST enable enrollment of students in multiple courses and track enrollment status and dates
- **FR-005**: System MUST support grade entry with separate internal assessment (30% weighting) and final assessment (70% weighting) components
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically calculate final weighted grades based on the formula: (Internal √ó 0.3) + (Final √ó 0.7)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for all student, course, and grade entities
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate comprehensive reports including student academic progress, course enrollment summaries, and grade distributions
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate all user input including roll number uniqueness, grade value ranges (0-100), and required field completion
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist all data to maintain records between system sessions
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a menu-driven interface for easy navigation of administrative functions
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow viewing of individual student records including all enrolled courses and current grades
- **FR-013**: System MUST support searching and filtering of student records by roll number, name, or course enrollment
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain referential integrity between students, courses, and grades when performing delete operations
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide confirmation prompts for destructive operations (deletions) to prevent accidental data loss

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Student**: Represents a primary school pupil with unique roll number, personal information (first name, last name, date of birth, contact details, emergency contacts), enrollment date, and academic status
- **Course**: Represents academic subjects offered by the school with course code, course name, description, duration, and availability status
- **Grade**: Represents academic assessment results linking students to courses with internal assessment score (30% weight), final assessment score (70% weight), calculated final grade, and assessment dates
- **Enrollment**: Represents the relationship between students and courses with enrollment date, status, and completion tracking
