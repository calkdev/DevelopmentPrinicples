# Feature Specification: Enterprise Architecture Implementation for Student Management System

**Feature Branch**: `002-junior-developer-implementation`  
**Created**: 9 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Junior developer implementation following TalentHub Wellington's proven enterprise patterns learned from senior team members:

PROVEN TALENTHUB ARCHITECTURE (adapted for learning):
- Presentation Layer: Console UI with hierarchical menu system (TalentHub's successful admin/student pattern)
- Business Logic Layer: Student, Course, Assessment entities (enhanced TalentHub Student/Course design)
- Data Access Layer: FileHandler static utility (TalentHub's proven repository pattern)
- Data Layer: CSV persistence with comprehensive error handling (TalentHub's reliable approach)

LEARNING OBJECTIVES DEMONSTRATED:
- Encapsulation: Private data with public interfaces (TalentHub's proven encapsulation model)
- Composition: Student contains Assessment objects (stronger than TalentHub's association pattern)
- Abstraction: Complex operations hidden behind simple methods (TalentHub's interface design)
- Polymorphism: Assessment type variations with shared interface (evolution of TalentHub patterns)
- RAII: Automatic resource management with STL containers (TalentHub's memory management approach)

JUNIOR DEVELOPER GROWTH AREAS:
- Adapting proven TalentHub patterns to new domain requirements
- Understanding why TalentHub's architecture succeeded and how to replicate it
- Comprehensive documentation explaining design decisions for mentor review
- Code structure facilitating team collaboration and future enhancements"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a junior software developer learning enterprise patterns, I need to implement a student management system that follows proven architectural patterns from our successful TalentHub Wellington project, enabling me to demonstrate understanding of professional software development practices while delivering a functional system that meets educational institution requirements and provides clear evidence of technical growth for senior developer mentorship and career advancement.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a junior developer needs to demonstrate OOP mastery, **When** they implement the student management system using proven TalentHub patterns, **Then** the code structure clearly shows proper encapsulation, composition, abstraction, and polymorphism with comprehensive documentation explaining design decisions
2. **Given** senior developers need to assess technical growth, **When** they review the implemented system, **Then** they can clearly identify how proven enterprise patterns were adapted and applied with evidence of understanding rather than blind copying
3. **Given** the system needs to handle real educational data, **When** administrators use the student management functions, **Then** all operations work reliably using the same proven patterns that made TalentHub successful
4. **Given** future team collaboration is required, **When** other developers examine the codebase, **Then** the architecture is immediately recognizable and maintainable due to consistent application of established patterns
5. **Given** mentorship sessions occur, **When** senior developers review the implementation, **Then** they can provide targeted feedback on pattern application and identify areas for continued growth
6. **Given** the system requires future enhancements, **When** new features need to be added, **Then** the layered architecture supports extension without breaking existing functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a junior developer misapplies a proven pattern and needs guidance?
- How does the system maintain quality when adapting TalentHub patterns to new domain requirements?
- What occurs when the implemented architecture needs to demonstrate specific OOP principles for assessment?
- How does the system support learning progression from basic pattern recognition to advanced pattern adaptation?
- What happens when mentorship feedback requires architectural modifications while maintaining proven pattern integrity?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement a layered architecture that clearly demonstrates separation of concerns following the proven TalentHub Wellington model with identifiable presentation, business logic, data access, and data layers
- **FR-002**: System MUST demonstrate proper encapsulation with private data members and controlled public interfaces that match the quality standards observed in TalentHub's successful implementation
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement composition relationships between entities that show understanding of object ownership and lifecycle management beyond TalentHub's basic association patterns
